Node-graph visualization and editing with PySide.

Very WIP right now, the goal is to have a bunch of premade components that make it easy to implement a node graph to store and modify arbitrary data.


This started as a port of the original Qt/C++ tool ``qnodeseditor`` by Stanislaw Adaszewski, see:
